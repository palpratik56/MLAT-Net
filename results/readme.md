This directory contains some of the representative experimental results and the model architecture diagram generated during the evaluation of MLAT-Net. The results are provided to facilitate transparency, reproducibility, and a clearer understanding of the model’s performance across different benchmark datasets. Detailed experimental settings, hyperparameters, and implementation details are described in the main paper.
