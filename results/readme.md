This directory contains representative experimental results and the model architecture diagram generated during the evaluation of MLAT-Net. The results are provided to facilitate transparency, reproducibility, and a clearer understanding of the model’s performance across different benchmark datasets.

Specifically, this folder includes:

- Training and validation convergence curves

- Visual segmentation outputs and qualitative comparisons

- Decoder feature maps

These results correspond to the experiments reported in the associated manuscript and are organized dataset-wise for clarity. Detailed experimental settings, hyperparameters, and implementation details are described in the main paper.
